title: Get Off My Lawn

There's been a lot of drama among the iOS community these
days relating to a variety of topics. From
[how Xcode can't handle my scale](http://www.quora.com/Facebook-Paper-product/What-was-it-like-to-help-develop-Paper),
to
[Objective-C needing a replacement](http://ashfurrow.com/blog/we-need-to-replace-objective-c),
to usage of Cocoapods.

Almost every tweet, every blog post, every Quora answer I
would read really only showed me one thing: the entitlement
that many of these opinions carried, as if their opinion was
not just an opinion, but rather fact.

Everyone is entitled to their opinion, sure. But to bash
others for their opinion is just wrong.

The way I've noticed a lot of iOS dev's acting lately has
been a lot like an old man telling everyone to get off his
lawn. Different things work for different people. There's no
need to force your own opinions upon others. Listen to
others and accept what they have to say. Form your own
opinion based on it. But **stop with the petty subtweets,
stop with the bashing of the work of others, stop with the
outcry of how shitty our tools are.**

If you don't like something, don't use it. Simple as that.
Facebook doesn't like Xcode, so they don't use it.
[Jeff Lamarche doesn't like Cocoapods](https://twitter.com/jeff_lamarche/status/433720595314794498),
so he doesn't use it. Ash Furrow doesn't like the current
state of Objective-C, ...so I guess he's stuck with it (I
kid, there's alternatives out there that
[he's trying like Eero](https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/433595981138235392),
[RubyMotion, Xamarin](https://twitter.com/ashfurrow/status/434009653895499776)
etc., too). My point is, everyone is different.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>Throwing some positivism into the twitter-sphere. I liked <a href="https://twitter.com/CocoaPods">@CocoaPods</a> a lot, but it didn’t do what I wanted. So I fixed it &amp; helped. OSS wins</p>&mdash; orta (@orta) <a href="https://twitter.com/orta/statuses/433723905082392576">February 12, 2014</a></blockquote>

I've been watching a lot of the Olympics this week and an
entertaining bit for me has been Johnny Weir.
[Johnny Weir's outfits](http://www.sbnation.com/lookit/2014/2/11/5401156/johnny-weir-olympic-outfit-tracker-sochi-2014)
everyday have been off the wall, flamboyant and
attention-grabbing. Watching him as he attempts to make a
statement in Russia, voicing his opinion, his beliefs, in a
way that doesn't harm others, has been awesome to follow.

We could take a note from Johnny Weir, and voice our
opinions in a way that doesn't attack others. Start making
cool things with the tools you like. Start making cool tools
that help others make cool things in the way that you work.
**Speak with your apps and code instead of 140 characters.**
